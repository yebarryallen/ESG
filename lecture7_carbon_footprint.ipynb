    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through `0209Lecture 6 - Firm Valuation .pdf` **page by page** and adds\n",
    "**carbon-footprint (GHG) accounting** intuition plus **Python practice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "1. Connect Scope 1/2/3 emissions to cash-flow and discount-rate drivers.\n",
    "2. Build a simple DCF model in Python from financial statements.\n",
    "3. Map a carbon footprint to a carbon-cost scenario (carbon price × emissions).\n",
    "4. Run sensitivity analysis (WACC, terminal growth, carbon price / intensity).\n",
    "5. Discuss how carbon intensity can refine comparable-company selection.\n"
